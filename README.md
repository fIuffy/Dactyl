# Dactyl: 1.12.2 Forge Utility Mod

**Overview:**  
Dactyl is a utility mod developed for Minecraft 1.12.2, specifically designed for anarchy servers like 2b2t. While the code is a few years old and not intended for further updates or maintenance, it remains functional on 1.12.2.

**Key Features:**  
- Originally a private project, now made public due to a shift in focus away from anarchy.
- Although the codebase could benefit from optimization, it includes a custom framework distinct from common mods.
- Contains various components sourced from other projects, including:
  - **OutlineUtils** by Hexception
  - **Old Future PacketFly** from Future 2.10
  - Elements from 3arthqu4ke (Phobos)

**Note:**  
For those interested, older versions are available through GitHub commits, which may be better suited for specific servers. 

**Acknowledgments:**  
I appreciate the contributions from those mentioned above and do not plan to engage with anarchy-related projects in the future.
